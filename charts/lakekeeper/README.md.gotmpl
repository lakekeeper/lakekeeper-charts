Please check our [Documentation](http://docs.lakekeeper.io), the [Lakekeeper Repository](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper) and the [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper-charts/blob/main/charts/lakekeeper/values.yaml) for more information.

## ⚠️ Important Notice: Migration from Bitnami to groundhog2k

This Chart used to rely on the Bitnami PostgreSQL Helm chart for postgres for both Lakekeeper and OpenFGA. Due to the [Bitnami Secure Images initiative](https://news.broadcom.com/app-dev/broadcom-introduces-bitnami-secure-images-for-production-ready-containerized-applications), this was no longer possible. We now moved to [`groundhog2k/posgres`](https://github.com/groundhog2k/helm-charts) with Chart Version `0.8.0`.

**Changes:**
- Version `0.7.1`: Transition from Bitnami images to self-hosted images on Quay.io to ensure deployment stability
- Version `0.8.0`: Migration to [`groundhog2k/posgres`](https://github.com/groundhog2k/helm-charts).

**Important notes:**
- No automatic migration will be provided by this chart
- **Back up your database before updating to prevent data loss**
- As noted in the installation section and [Production Checklist](https://docs.lakekeeper.io/docs/nightly/production/), the databases included with this chart are **not production-ready**

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
helm repo add lakekeeper https://lakekeeper.github.io/lakekeeper-charts/
helm install my-lakekeeper lakekeeper/lakekeeper
```

⚠️ This chart by default deploys the "postgresql" subchart. This setup is not production ready. For production deployments, please deploy an external database, set `postgresql.enabled` to false and use the `externalDatabase.*` parameters to configure the connection. To deploy production ready Databases on Kubernetes, we recommend to use the [`CloudNativePGOperator`](https://cloudnative-pg.io/).

For potential additional steps that are required for upgrades, please check the [Changelog](./Changelog)
